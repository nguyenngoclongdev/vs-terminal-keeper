### Terminal Options

```ts
// A human-readable string which will be used to represent the terminal in the UI.
name: string,

// The command list.
commands: Array<string>,

// The operators to join multiple commands. e.g. semicolon (;), logical OR (||), logical AND (&&) and more
joinOperator?: string,

// Automatically execute the specified commands.
autoExecuteCommands?: boolean,

// A path or Uri for the current working directory to be used for the terminal.
cwd?: string,

// The id of the color. The available colors are listed in https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference.
color?: string,

// The id of the icon. The available icons are listed in https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing.
icon?: string,

// Object with environment variables that will be added to the editor process.
env?: object,

// When enabled the terminal will run the process as normal but not be surfaced to the user until Terminal.show is called. The typical usage for this is when you need to run something that may need interactivity but only want to tell the user about it when interaction is needed. Note that the terminals will still be exposed to all extensions as normal.
hideFromUser?: boolean,

// Opt-out of the default terminal persistence on restart and reload. This will only take effect when terminal.integrated.enablePersistentSessions is enabled.
isTransient?: boolean,

// A message to write to the terminal on first launch, note that this is not sent to the process but, rather written directly to the terminal. This supports escape sequences such a setting text style.
message?: string,

// Args for the custom shell executable. A string can be used on Windows only which allows specifying shell args in command-line format.
shellArgs?: Array<string>,

// A path to a custom shell executable to be used in the terminal.
shellPath?: string,

// Whether the terminal process environment should be exactly as provided in TerminalOptions.env. When this is false (default), the environment will be based on the window's environment and also apply configured platform settings like terminal.integrated.env.windows on top. When this is true, the complete environment must be provided as nothing will be inherited from the process or any configuration.
strictEnv?: boolean,

// ‚ú® Focused the terminal on startup.
focus?: boolean
```

### Optional: Hide Terminal Commands in Explorer Descriptions

By default, Terminal Keeper shows the commands for each terminal as a description in the explorer tree view. If you prefer a cleaner look, you can hide these descriptions by setting the following option in your VS Code settings:

```json
"terminal-keeper.hideCommandsInExplorerDescriptions": true
```

This will remove the command text from the explorer tree items, showing only the terminal names.

## Troubleshoot

If you see the error message `The terminal process failed to launch: A native exception occurred during launch (posix_spawnp failed.).` while running your vscode, it's important to know that this error is not caused by the `Terminal Keeper`, but rather by VSCode itself. Therefore, it's recommended that you don't submit an issue to `Terminal Keeper` regarding this error.

This error is usually caused by VSCode's inability to start a new terminal process. There could be various reasons why this error occurs, such as incorrect configuration or conflicts with other programs on your system.

If you encounter this error, you can try quitting all instances of VSCode and reopening it, or restarting your computer to see if the problem is resolved. If the problem persists, you can refer to the troubleshooting guide provided by VSCode or seek help from the VSCode community through forums or support pages.

You can find more information about this error and how to troubleshoot it at this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/troubleshoot-terminal-launch
